# Material for IETF120 side meeting on "Inter-DC AI: Requirements and Challenges"

(Large data) AI has been growing significantly in demands for computing and networking resources, where boundaries for future growth are being set power consumption (including location of the DC), space and cooling tech as well as complexity and cost. This has led to the emerging view that inter-DC AI computation is the way forward to overcome those local DC challenges.

This side meeting at IETF120 will start the needed dialogue to identify and discuss key challenges on (1) congestion control to improve goodput across DCs, (2) efficient support for cross-DC collective communication primitives, (3) obtaining suitable knowledge of network topologies across underlays to segregate training tasks across DCs, (4) utilizing new congestion control mechanisms to optimize large-scale inferencing traffic from millions of clients to  few Points of Presence (PoPs), as well as (5) providing suitable means to attest for secure and private transfer of needed training input data from customers to AI training providers. 

The side meeting will feature presentations to tease out key insights from various players in this field, leaving dedicated time for discussing possible next and concrete steps in the IETF to move forward.
